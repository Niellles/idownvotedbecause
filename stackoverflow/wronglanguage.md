{::comment} I am delibrately avoiding contractions here, so ESL people can read it easier. {:/}

## We can't read your language {#introduction}
Contrary to popular beleif, we can not read your mind; only what you write. When we can not read what you write, we can not answer the question.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Your post is not in english. That's okay! However, Stack overflow is in english, so anything not in english does not get answered.
There are several Stack Overflow communities in other languages. If there is one for your language, ask a moderator to migrate it there.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
{::comment}In this section, you can describe why the problem is worth a downvote within the community in which it was posted{:/}
If the question is important enough to ask in a dedicated english community, it is worth your time to write it in english.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Translate your post! If your English is *really bad*, feel free to use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com); it is better than nothing.

{::comment}The following paragraphs should be added as is to the bottom of all pages{:/}
## Leave a comment! {#leaveacomment}
Once you have done this, leave a comment to the person who sent you this link. They will be happy to retract their downvote.
